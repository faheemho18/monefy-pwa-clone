## Development Notes

### Key Components to Build
- `TransactionModal` - Main transaction entry interface
- `TransactionList` - Display and manage transactions
- `BalanceDisplay` - Show current balance and trends
- `CategoryIcon` - Render SVG category icons
- `CategoryGrid` - Category selection interface

### Utilities to Create
- `balanceCalculations.ts` - Balance and stats calculations
- `localStorage.ts` - Local storage operations
- `formatters.ts` - Currency and date formatters
- `validators.ts` - Form validation schemas

### Assets to Use
- Category icons: `/src/assets/icons/categories/` (8 SVG files)
- UI icons: `/src/assets/icons/ui/` (add, close, delete, edit, filter)
- Animation assets: `/src/assets/animations/` (checkmark, progress-ring)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities and pure functions
- Component tests for user interactions
- Integration tests for data flow
- Visual regression tests for responsive design
